
This file defines derived entity types that are based on the entity types of
adjacent polygons. Seperate translation blocks are defined for those line entity
types that need to be translated. Each block of translations starts with a
record that contains the word "BEGIN", and ends with a record that contains
the word "END".

Immediately after the BEGIN statement, you must specify the line entity type
that the block refers to. To do this, specify the keyword "ENTITY=", followed
by the name of the entity type.

You can also (optionally) restrict translation to a specific theme. To do that,
specify the keyword "THEME=", followed by the name of the theme. If you do not
specify a theme, the translation will be made for all themes.

Each translation must fit on a single line, and take the form:

 <derived type> = <polygon entity type> \ <polygon entity type>

In situations where the second polygon entity type is immaterial, the field must
be left blank (i.e. the last character in that sort of translation must be the
backslash character). Note that each list is hierarchical. If a given line matches
more than one translation, the first matching translation is the one that will be
used.

Any record in this file that appears outside a BEGIN-END block is treated as a
comment. Blank records are ignored.
