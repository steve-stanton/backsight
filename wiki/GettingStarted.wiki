#summary Getting Started

Backsight is coded in C# and NET 2.0. It consists of 2 main applications:

  # The Cadastral Editor is used to enter data from survey plans.
  # The Environment Editor is used to define things like the names of valid map layers.

Before you can use the Cadastral Editor, you need to use the Environment Editor to define the sort of information you want to store. The Environment Editor uses a SQLServer database to store this definition. If you don't already have access to SQLServer, you can download SQLServer Express from [http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/sql here] (the SQLServer Management Studio is also a handy utility that you can download from the same place). Once you have SQLServer installed, create a new database called Backsight.

When you start the Environment Editor for the very first time, it will look for a database called Backsight on your computer. If it cannot find one, you get the following message:

  The Environment Editor doesn't have a record of the database
  where information should be stored. Please pick an existing
  database, or click Cancel to exit.

Browse to the database you want to use and click the Connect button. If it's a brand new database, a dialog appears that contains the following message:

  The selected database does not appear to contain Backsight system tables.
  Click the Create button to create them now, or Cancel if you wish to use some other database.

Click the Create button to create the database tables where the Environment Editor will store stuff.
